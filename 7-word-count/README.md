File Word Count
================

Write a program that takes a filename and a parameter `n` and prints the `n` most common words in the file, and the count of their occurrences, in descending order.

For example:

		word_stats("article.txt", 5)

		"the", 39
		"device", 21
		"start", 14
		"pidgeon", 9
		"box", 3

Import the included `article.txt` file and use that to test your program. What are the top 10 words and their frequency?
