Remove The Dupes!
==================

You have a string "aabbccddeded". We want to remove all the _consecutive_ duplicates and put them in a separate string, which yields two separate instances of the string "abcdeded".

    input: "balloons"

    input: "aabbccddeded"
    expected output: "abcdeded" "abcd"
    
    input: "flabby aapples"
