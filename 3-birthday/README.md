Age Calculator
===============

###Part 1

Create a program that will take user input and tell them their age in months, days, hours, and minutes.

Sample output:
```
How old are you? 18
months : 216, days : 6480, hours : 155520, and minutes : 388800
```

###Part 2

Add a function to your program that takes the user's birthday as input in `YYYY-MM-DD` format and tells them their age in months, days, hours and minutes in the same fashion.

Hint: Take a look at Python's `datetime` library.
